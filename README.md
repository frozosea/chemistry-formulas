 To find the maximum compression of the spring, we need to consider the energy transfer that occurs when the ball of mass m collides with the plate of mass M, which is placed on top of the spring with spring constant k.

When the ball falls, it has gravitational potential energy due to its height h and kinetic energy due to its initial speed v0. Upon collision, because it is elastic, energy is conserved.

The total mechanical energy just before the collision is equal to the potential energy from the height h, plus the kinetic energy from the speed v0:

$$ \[E_{total} = mgh + \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \] $$

Upon collision, the ball transfers energy to the plate, and the spring starts to compress. At maximum compression, all this energy will be stored as elastic potential energy in the spring:

$$ \[E_{spring} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \]$$

By setting E_total = E_spring, we can solve for x, the maximum compression of the spring:

$$\[ mgh + \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \]$$

$$\[ x^2 = \frac{2mgh + mv_0^2}{k} \]$$

However, during the collision, because momentum is conserved and the collision is elastic, kinetic energy is also conserved. The ball and the plate, after the collision, will move together with the same velocity because they are in contact and compressing the spring together. The combined mass during the compression will be \( M + m \).

Therefore, we calculate the velocity \( v \) after the collision using conservation of momentum:

$$\[ mv_0 = (M + m)v \]$$

Solve for \( v \):

$$\[ v = \frac{mv_0}{M + m} \]$$

This velocity is the initial velocity for the system (ball plus plate) compressing the spring. Now, convert all of the kinetic energy into spring potential energy:

$$\[ \frac{1}{2} (M + m) v^2 = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \]$$

Substitute \( v \) from the momentum equation into the energy equation:

$$\[ \frac{1}{2} (M + m) \left(\frac{mv_0}{M + m}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \]$$

This simplifies to:

$$\[ \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{m^2 v_0^2}{M + m}\right) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \]$$

$$\[ \frac{m^2 v_0^2}{M + m} = k x^2 \]$$

We then isolate \( x \) (taking the positive solution, as we are interested in the magnitude of compression):

$$\[ x^2 = \frac{m^2 v_0^2}{k (M + m)} \]$$

$$\[ x = \frac{m v_0}{\sqrt{k (M + m)}} \]$$

However, this \( x \) only represents the additional compression of the spring due to the kinetic energy of the ball's original movement. We must also consider the compression due to the gravitational potential energy when the plate moves down by distance \( h \). That compression is \( x_g = \frac{Mg}{k} \), which we derive from \( Mg = kx_g \).

The total compression (x_total) is the sum of the compression due to the drop (x_g) and the additional compression due to the collision (x):

$$\[ x_{total} = x_g + x \]$$

$$\[ x_{total} = \frac{Mg}{k} + \frac{m v_0}{\sqrt{k (M + m)}} \]$$

To incorporate the effect of \( h \) and the ball's gravitational potential energy on the compression of the spring, we need to use the velocity \( v \) the ball achieves just before impact due to falling from height \( h \). That velocity is found using the equation:

$$\[ v^2 = v_0^2 + 2gh \]$$

The energy that the velocity \( v \) represents (after substituting for the ball falling through height \( h \)) must be included in the spring compression. Therefore, the corrected equation for the additional compression due to gravitational potential energy and the initial velocity \( v_0 \) is:

$$\[ x = \sqrt{\frac{2m (mgh + 0.5 m v_0^2)}{k (M + m)}} \]$$

which reduces to

$$\[ x = \sqrt{\frac{2mgh}{k}} \frac{m}{\sqrt{M + m}} \]$$

Hence, the full equation for the total compression x_total becomes:
