# The first law of thermodynamics

The first law of thermodynamicscan be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$\[ \Delta U = Q - W \]$$

Where:
- $\( \Delta U \)$ represents the change in internal energy of the system.
- $\( Q \)$ represents the heat added to the system (positive when heat is added).
- $\( W \)$ represents the work done by the system on its surroundings (positive when work is done by the system).

# Pressure-volume work

Pressure-volume work, often denoted as $\(PV\)$ work, is a type of mechanical work performed by or on a system as a result of a change in its volume while it is under the influence of an external pressure. This concept is a fundamental part of thermodynamics and plays a key role in understanding processes such as gas expansion or compression.

The formula for pressure-volume work $(\(PV\)$ work) is as follows:

$$\[W = -P \Delta V\]$$
$$\(p = -\frac{W}{V_2 - V_1}\)$$

Where:
- $\(W\)$ represents the work done on or by the system.
- $\(P\)$ is the pressure of the system.
- $\(\Delta V\)$ is the change in volume of t


# Heat of reaction of chemical reactions

The heat of reaction, also known as the enthalpy change of a chemical reaction, is a measure of the heat energy either absorbed (endothermic reaction) or released (exothermic reaction) during a chemical reaction. It is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics and is represented by the symbol $\(ΔH\)$, where ΔH stands for the change in enthalpy.

Enthalpy $(\(H\))$ is a thermodynamic property that combines the internal energy of a system with the pressure-volume work done by or on the system. The heat of reaction can be calculated by the following equation:

$$\[ΔH = H_{\text{products}} - H_{\text{reactants}}\]$$

# Gauss's Law

The general form of a standard molar enthalpy of formation reaction is as follows:

$$\[aA + bB + \ldots \rightarrow \text{Compound}\]$$

In this reaction:

- $\(a\), \(b\), etc.$, represent the stoichiometric coefficients of the elements or compounds on the left side of the reaction.
- "Compound" represents the compound for which you want to calculate the \(ΔH^\circ_f\) value.

# Calculate ΔSm


The change in molar entropy $(\(ΔS_m\))$ for a chemical reaction can be calculated using the following general equation:

$$\[ΔS_m = ΣS_m(products) - ΣS_m(reactants)\]$$

Where:
- $\(ΔS_m\)$ is the change in molar entropy.
- $\(ΣS_m(products)\)$ is the sum of the standard molar entropies of the products.
- $\(ΣS_m(reactants)\)$ is the sum of the standard molar entropies of the reactants.

# Gibbs function change and direction of chemical reaction
The change in Gibbs free energy $(\(ΔG\))$ plays a crucial role in determining the direction of a chemical reaction. Gibbs free energy is a thermodynamic potential that combines the enthalpy $(\(ΔH\))$ and the entropy $(\(ΔS\))$ of a system. The relationship between \(ΔG\), \(ΔH\), and \(ΔS\) is given by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:

$$\[ΔG = ΔH - TΔS\]$$

Where:
- $\(ΔG\)$ is the change in Gibbs free energy.
- $\(ΔH\)$ is the change in enthalpy.
- $\(ΔS\)$ is the change in entropy.
- $\(T\)$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

The sign of $\(ΔG\)$ determines the spontaneity and direction of a chemical reaction:

1. **ΔG < 0 (Negative):** If $\(ΔG\)$ is negative, the reaction is said to be "spontaneous" in the forward direction. This means the reaction will tend to proceed from reactants to products without any external intervention. It is an exergonic reaction.

2. **ΔG > 0 (Positive):** If $\(ΔG\)$ is positive, the reaction is "non-spontaneous" in the forward direction. The reverse reaction is favored. Energy must be supplied to make the reaction occur. It is an endergonic reaction.

3. **ΔG = 0:** When $\(ΔG\)$ is zero, the reaction is at equilibrium. There is no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products. The system is in a state of dynamic equilibrium, and the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.

The relationship between $\(ΔG\)$ and the direction of a chemical reaction is summarized in the Gibbs free energy change $(\(ΔG\))$ equation:

$$\[ΔG = ΔH - TΔS\]$$

- If $\(ΔG\)$ is negative (ΔH is negative and TΔS is smaller), the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction.
- If $\(ΔG\)$ is positive (ΔH is positive and TΔS is larger), the reaction is non-spontaneous in the forward direction.
- If $\(ΔG\)$ is zero (ΔH equals TΔS), the reaction is at equilibrium.

# Ideal Gas Mixture
Consider an ideal gas mixture containing two components A and B. Among them, the amount of substance in component A is $n_A\$, and component B is amount of substance is $n_s$. Under constant temperature and constant volume conditions, their respective equations of state are:

$\[p_aV = n_aRT\]$

$\[p_bV = n_bRT\]$

or just:

$\[pV = nRT\]$

Here's what each symbol represents in this equation:

- **p**: The pressure of a gas (in pascals, Pa).
- **V**: The volume of the gas (in cubic meters, m³).
- **$n_a$**: The number of moles of a specific component of the gas (sometimes represented as $n_1$ or $n_A$).
- **R**: The ideal gas constant, approximately 8.314 J/(mol·K) (joules per mole-kelvin).
- **T**: The absolute temperature of the gas (in kelvin, K).

# Standard equilibrium constant
The standard equilibrium constant, often denoted as $\(K^\circ\)$, is a thermodynamic constant that describes the equilibrium position of a chemical reaction at standard conditions. It is used to quantitatively express the extent to which a chemical reaction proceeds at equilibrium. The standard conditions typically refer to a temperature of 298.15 K (25°C) and a pressure of 1 bar (100 kPa).

The standard equilibrium constant is defined for a chemical reaction in the following general form:

$$\[aA + bB \rightleftharpoons cC + dD\]$$

Where:
- $\(a\)$, $\(b\)$, $\(c\)$, and $\(d\)$ are the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants (A and B) and products (C and D) in the balanced chemical equation.
- $\(K^\circ\)$ is the standard equilibrium constant for this reaction.

The expression for the standard equilibrium constant, $\(K^\circ\)$, is based on the law of mass action and is given by:

$$\[K^\circ = \frac{{[C]^c [D]^d}}{{[A]^a [B]^b}}\]$$

In this equation, square brackets $\([ ]\)$ denote the molar concentrations of the species involved in the reaction. Note that the standard equilibrium constant is dimensionless, as the concentrations are typically expressed in moles per liter (M or mol/L).

The value of $\(K^\circ\)$ provides important information about the position of the equilibrium for a specific reaction at standard conditions:

1. If $\(K^\circ > 1\)$, it indicates that the equilibrium position lies far to the right, favoring the products (C and D).
2. If $\(K^\circ < 1\)$, it suggests that the equilibrium position is shifted to the left, favoring the reactants (A and B).
3. If $\(K^\circ = 1\)$, it implies that the concentrations of the products and reactants are roughly equal at equilibrium.

# Gibbs's function and G&K relationship 

Certainly, let's discuss the relationship between the standard Gibbs function change (ΔG°) and the standard equilibrium constant (K) for a chemical reaction.

The standard Gibbs function change (ΔG°) is a thermodynamic property that describes the change in the Gibbs free energy of a chemical system during a reaction under standard conditions (usually at 25°C and 1 atm pressure). The Gibbs free energy change for a chemical reaction is a key factor in determining whether a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous.

The standard equilibrium constant (K) is a measure of the extent to which a chemical reaction proceeds to reach equilibrium under standard conditions. It is related to the concentrations of products and reactants at equilibrium. The expression for K depends on the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.

The relationship between ΔG° and K can be expressed as follows:

$$ΔG_m°(T)° = -RT * ln(K)$$

$$ln(K) = -ΔG_m°(T) / RT$$

$$lg(K) = -ΔG_m°(T) / 2.303RT$$

$$ΔG_m°(T) = -RT ln(K°) + RT ln(Пв(p_B/p°)^v_B)$$

$$ΔG_m°(T) = ΔrH° - T*ΔSm $$

Where:
- $ΔG°$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change.
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K) or 0.008314 kJ/(mol·K)).
- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.
- $K$ is the standard equilibrium constant.
- $Пв$ represents the vapor pressure.
- $v_B$ represents the coefficient of the component B in the balanced chemical equation (moles of B).


This equation tells us that the sign of $ΔG°$ determines the spontaneity of a reaction:
- If $ΔG° < 0 (negative)$, the reaction is spontaneous, and $K > 1$.
- If $ΔG° = 0$, the reaction is at equilibrium, and $K = 1$.
- If $ΔG° > 0 (positive)$, the reaction is non-spontaneous, and $K < 1$.

# Ka
The acid dissociation constant $K_a$ is a measure of the extent to which an acid ionizes in a solution. It is defined for the equilibrium reaction:

$$\[ \text{HA} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{A}^- \]$$

The expression for the acid dissociation constant $K_a$ is given by:

$$\[ K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \]$$

Where:
- $K_a$ is the acid dissociation constant,
- $\text{H}^+$ is the concentration of hydrogen ions (protons) produced by the dissociation of the acid,
- $\text{A}^-$ is the concentration of the conjugate base ions,
- $\text{HA}$ is the concentration of the undissociated acid.

In the expression, square brackets denote concentrations in moles per liter (mol/L).

The larger the $K_a$, the stronger the acid. Conversely, a smaller $K_a$ indicates a weaker acid.

It's worth noting that when $K_a$ is very small, indicating a weak acid, the $pK_a$ value is often used. $pK_a$ is calculated as the negative logarithm (base 10) of $K_a$:

$$\[ pK_a = -\log_{10}(K_a) \]$$

The $pK_a$ values are useful for comparing the strengths of acids more conveniently, as larger $pK_a$ values correspond to weaker acids.

# Kb

The base dissociation constant $K_b$ is a measure of the extent to which a base ionizes in a solution. It is defined for the equilibrium reaction:

$$\[ \text{B} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{BH}^+ + \text{OH}^- \]$$

The expression for the base dissociation constant $K_b$ is given by:

$$\[ K_b = \frac{[\text{BH}^+][\text{OH}^-]}{[\text{B}]} \]$$

Where:
- $K_b$ is the base dissociation constant,
- $\text{BH}^{+}$ is the concentration of the conjugate acid ions,
- $\text{OH}^{-}]$ is the concentration of hydroxide ions produced by the dissociation of the base,
- $\text{B}$ is the concentration of the undissociated base.

In the expression, square brackets denote concentrations in moles per liter (mol/L).

Similar to $K_a$ for acids, the larger the $K_b$, the stronger the base. Conversely, a smaller $K_b$ indicates a weaker base.

Just like $pK_a$ for acids, for bases, the $pK_b$ value can be calculated as the negative logarithm (base 10) of $K_b$:

$$pK_b = -\log_{10}(K_b)$$

The $pK_b$ values are useful for comparing the strengths of bases more conveniently, as larger $pK_b$ values correspond to weaker bases.

# pOH and pH

$$C_H^{+} = \frac{c * V_1}{V_1+V_2}$$

$$ C_OH^{-} = \frac{c * V_2}{V_1+V_2}$$

$$Q = C_{H^{+}} * C_{OH^{-}} $$


$$ pOh = pK_{b} - lg(\frac{C_{HAc(основание)}}{c_{NaAc(кислота)}}) $$


$$ \[OH^-\] = 10^{-pOH} $$


$$ \[OH^-\] = K_b(\frac{c_{HAc}}{c_{NaAc}}) $$

$$ K_a = \frac{\[H^+][A^-]}{\[HA]} = \frac{\[H^+\{ c_{HAc}+\[H^+]\}]}{c_NaAc - \[H^+]} $$


$$ K_a = \frac{\[H^+]C_{HAc}}{c_{NaAc}} $$


$$ pH = 14 - pOH $$

# K_sp
$$K_sp °(HAc) = \[H^+]\[OH^-] = s^2$$

$$s = \sqrt(2, \frac{K_sp °}{1})$$

$$K_sp °(HAc) = \[H^+]\[OH^-]^2 = 4s^3$$

$$s = \sqrt(3, \frac{K_sp °}{4})$$

$$K_sp °(HAc) = \[H^+]\[OH^-]^3 = 27s^4$$

$$s = \sqrt(4, \frac{K_sp °}{27})$$
